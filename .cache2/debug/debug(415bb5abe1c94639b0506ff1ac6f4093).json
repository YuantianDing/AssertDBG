Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n\n    Examples:\n\n        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n        Output: [1, 2, 1]\n\n        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n        Output: [1]\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    N = len(grid)\n    assert N >= 2, f\"Grid must have at least 2 rows and 2 columns, found N={N}.\"\n    assert all(len(row) == N for row in grid), \"All rows must be the same length as columns.\"\n    assert 1 <= k <= N * N, f\"k must be between 1 and N*N, found k={k}.\"\n    assert all(isinstance(value, int) and 1 <= value <= N * N for row in grid for value in row), \\\n        \"All grid values must be integers between 1 and N*N.\"\n    values_found = set(value for row in grid for value in row)\n    assert len(values_found) == N * N, f\"Each integer from 1 to N*N must appear once in the grid, missing values or duplicates detected.\"\n\n    possible_paths = generate_all_possible_paths(grid, N, k)\n    assert possible_paths, \"Function generate_all_possible_paths must return non-empty list of paths.\"\n\n    min_path = find_minimum_lexicographical_path(possible_paths)\n    assert isinstance(min_path, list) and len(min_path) == k, \\\n        f\"The resulting path must be a list of length k, got {min_path}.\"\n    assert all(value in values_found for value in min_path), \\\n        \"All values in the resulting path must exist in the grid.\"\n\n    return min_path\n\ndef generate_all_possible_paths(grid, N, k):\n    # For the sake of this example, we just define the signature and handle input/output validation here.\n    assert isinstance(grid, list) and all(isinstance(row, list) for row in grid), \"Grid must be a list of lists.\"\n    assert isinstance(N, int) and N >= 2, \"N must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.\"\n    assert isinstance(k, int) and 1 <= k <= N * N, \"k must be an integer between 1 and N*N.\"\n    # Logical implementation will come here\n    pass\n\ndef find_minimum_lexicographical_path(paths):\n    # For the sake of this example, we just define the signature and handle input/output validation here.\n    assert isinstance(paths, list) and all(isinstance(path, list) for path in paths), \"Paths must be a list of lists.\"\n    # Logical implementation will come here\n    pass\n"}, "subfunctions": [{"function_name": "generate_all_possible_paths", "code": "from typing import List, Tuple\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef is_valid_move(x: int, y: int, N: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if a move is valid in the N x N grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    valid = 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N\n    assert isinstance(valid, bool), f\"Return type must be bool, got {type(valid).__name__}\"\n    return valid\n\ndef generate_paths_from_cell(grid: List[List[int]], N: int, k: int, start: Tuple[int, int], path: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively generate all paths of length k starting from a given cell and returning a list of paths.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert isinstance(grid, list) and all(isinstance(row, list) for row in grid), \"Grid must be a 2D list\"\n    assert isinstance(N, int) and N > 0, \"N must be a positive integer\"\n    assert all(len(row) == N for row in grid), \"Each row in the grid must be of length N\"\n    assert isinstance(k, int) and k >= 0, \"k must be a non-negative integer\"\n    assert isinstance(start, tuple) and len(start) == 2, \"Start must be a tuple of two integers\"\n    assert isinstance(path, list), \"Path must be a list\"\n    \n    x, y = start\n    assert 0 <= x < N, f\"Starting x-coordinate {x} must be within grid bounds\"\n    assert 0 <= y < N, f\"Starting y-coordinate {y} must be within grid bounds\"\n\n    if k == 0:\n        assert len(path) == len(set(path)), \"Path elements must be unique\"\n        return [path]\n\n    paths = []\n    \n    for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:  # All 4 possible directions\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if is_valid_move(nx, ny, N):\n            paths.extend(generate_paths_from_cell(grid, N, k -
