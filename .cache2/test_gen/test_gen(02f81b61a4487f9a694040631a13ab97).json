Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n\n    Examples:\n\n        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n        Output: [1, 2, 1]\n\n        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n        Output: [1]\n    \"\"\"\n", "add_error_msg": false}, "out": {"function_name": "test_minPath_function", "code": "import random\n\ndef test_minPath_function():\n    # Helper function to generate random grid\n    def generate_random_grid(n):\n        values = [i for i in range(1, n * n + 1)]\n        random.shuffle(values)\n        return [values[i * n:(i + 1) * n] for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Generate thousands of random test cases\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        N = random.randint(2, 10)  # Grid size\n        k = random.randint(1, N * N)  # Path length\n        grid = generate_random_grid(N)\n        result = minPath(grid, k)\n        \n        # Assert the result is of length k\n        assert len(result) == k\n        \n        # Assert result values are within grid values\n        for val in result:\n            assert any(val in row for row in grid)\n            \n    # Test edge cases\n    # Smallest grid and path length\n    grid = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n    k = 2\n    assert minPath(grid, k) == [1, 1]\n\n    # Path of length 1\n    grid = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]\n    k = 1\n    assert minPath(grid, k) == [1]\n\n    # A larger grid\n    grid = [[10, 2, 30], [40, 50, 6], [7, 8, 90]]\n    k = 3\n    result = minPath(grid, k)\n    assert len(result) == 3\n\n    # Verify lexical ordering of the path\n    assert all(grid[i // 3][i % 3] <= grid[j // 3][j % 3] for i, j in zip(result, result[1:]))\n    \n    # Maximum path (cover entire grid once)\n    grid = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n    k = 9\n    assert minPath(grid, k) == list(range(1, 10))"}}
