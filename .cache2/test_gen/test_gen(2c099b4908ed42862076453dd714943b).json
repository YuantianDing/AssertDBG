{"in": {"id": 0, "prompt": "\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, \n    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]\n    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.\n\n    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start\n    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,\n    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current\n    cell.\n    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not\n    necessarily distinct).\n    You CANNOT go off the grid.\n    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if\n    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go\n    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less\n    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)\n    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have\n    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].\n    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.\n    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.\n\n    Examples:\n\n        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3\n        Output: [1, 2, 1]\n\n        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1\n        Output: [1]\n    \"\"\"\n", "add_error_msg": true}, "out": {"function_name": "test_minPath_function", "code": "import random\n\ndef test_minPath_function():\n    # Test individual test cases\n    grid1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n    k1 = 3\n    expected1 = [1, 2, 1]\n    result1 = minPath(grid1, k1)\n    assert result1 == expected1, f\"Test case 1 failed: expected {expected1}, got {result1}\"\n\n    grid2 = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]\n    k2 = 1\n    expected2 = [1]\n    result2 = minPath(grid2, k2)\n    assert result2 == expected2, f\"Test case 2 failed: expected {expected2}, got {result2}\"\n\n    # Edge cases\n    grid3 = [[1, 3], [2, 4]]  # smallest possible N\n    k3 = 2\n    expected3 = [1, 2]  # possible minimal path\n    result3 = minPath(grid3, k3)\n    assert result3 == expected3, f\"Edge case 3 failed: expected {expected3}, got {result3}\"\n\n    grid4 = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\n    k4 = 4\n    expected4 = [1, 2, 1, 2]  # minimal path choosing smallest numbers\n    result4 = minPath(grid4, k4)\n    assert result4 == expected4, f\"Edge case 4 failed: expected {expected4}, got {result4}\"\n\n    # Random large test\n    n = 5\n    grid_large = [[j + i * n + 1 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n    k_large = 5\n    result_large = minPath(grid_large, k_large)\n    assert isinstance(result_large, list) and len(result_large) == k_large, \"Random large test failed: result length mismatch or type error.\"\n\n    # Generate thousands of random test cases\n    for _ in range(1000):\n        n = random.randint(2, 10)  # N between 2 and 10 for feasible computation\n        grid_random = [[j + i * n + 1 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]\n        k_random = random.randint(1, n * n)  # k between 1 and N*N\n        result_random = minPath(grid_random, k_random)\n        assert isinstance(result_random, list) and len(result_random) == k_random, \"Random test failed: result length mismatch or type error.\"\n\n    print(\"All test cases passed!\")\n"}}
