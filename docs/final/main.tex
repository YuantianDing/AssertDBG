\begin{abstract}
    Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in code generation, yet they frequently produce programs with subtle, hard-to-detect bugs. To address this challenge, I proposed an assertion-based debugging framework that emulates expert debugging strategies to identify and correct errors in LLM-generated code. Our approach leverages a multi-agent architecture: a divide-and-conquer agent decomposes complex problems into smaller, tractable subtasks; programmer agents generate code enriched with strategic assertions; and a debugger agent iteratively analyzes assertion failures to refine incorrect outputs. By incorporating assertions into the debugging process, our framework improves robustness and correctness, achieving a 3\% performance gain on the HumanEvalPlus benchmark suite.

% \section*{Accessibility}
% Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
% Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
% camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
% done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
% submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
% the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
% system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
% when writing their review.



% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.
